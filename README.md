# Bitcoin Network Analysis
## Abstract
The  Bitcoin  network  presents  a  unique  opportunity  to  explore  an  anonymized  world wide  payment system  where  each  transaction  is  publicly  available  and  accessible.   Using  Bitcoin  transaction  data from  2011,  we  will  examine  how  this  network  propagates  and  what  makes  this  particular  network unique.  In this paper, we will delve into the characteristics of different transactions in order to identify the main actors within the network and the correlations between the tides of public opinion and the classes of users propagating the network.  In 2011, Bitcoin saw a drastic change in the number of users and the value Bitcoin itself.  We would like to identify the key players in the network and evaluate how  their  influence  changes  over  time.   Touted  as  a  truly  decentralized  network,  we  will  determine the  validity  of  this  claim  and  the  realities  surrounding  the  main  actors  within  this  system  in  order to quantify how amenable this currency system is to the machinations of large entities.  Using these metrics, we want to determine if the Bitcoin network can sustain itself as a lasting stable currency

## Methods
This research was conducted using a network based approach. Specifically, we ran various centrality measures on all transactions at specific time zones. Normalizing these results allowed us to compare our results and determine the changing influence of nodes in the network.

## Technology Used
